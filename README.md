# Google-Play-App-Analysis
This data science project is an analysis of user behavior, on the relashionship of an app size and price, to it's popularity, in terms of rating and total downloads. This project was conducted using Python, in a Jupiter Notebook, including libraries like pandas, numpy and seaborn, for data cleaning, transformation and visualization.


The project consisted on importing a dataset in .csv format, and cleaning that dataset to select the proper categories. From the dataset, I filtered app ratings and plotted in order to visualize any trends. The first main highlight was the app size, where a larger apps held higher ratings. That would be reasoned due to quality and content. Secondly, I decided to analyse the price in relation to rating. As many companies aim to use the app price as a marketing strategy.


Analysing the data of how free and priced apps perform in terms of popularity and rating, using a sentiment review, the results were that, in average, both categories perform similarly, but the paid apps have less extreme negative ratings when compared to Free ones, while the downloads for free are on average 10 times higher than paid.
